# Brainf*ck Programming Language
## Description
In addition to the Monty Language interpreter for Stacks and Queues,
I also learnt about the Brainf*ck language in this project. 
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.
Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.
The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding, as it was not meant or made for designing actual software but for challenging the boundaries of computer programming.

### Project Details
Using the Basic eight commands of Brainf*ck, I was able to tackle string output as in file `1000-school.bf`, addition and multiplication of user inputs as in `1001-add.bf`, `1002-mul.bf` and `1003-mul.bf`. Just what the project tasks required, but more later.

### Issues
I had some challenges in outputting the product of user input in a new line feed, so, here goes the **disclaimer**: file `1003-mul.bf` does not really work. Oops!
I am still working on it though, we'll get back to it soon.

### Resources
- ALX SE program provided a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) link for guidance on Brainf*ck Language.
- I also got some very helpful insights from this [Medium](https://saketupadhyay.medium.com/how-to-code-in-brainf-ck-without-losing-your-mind-6a8fd67b36b4) article.
